# Manic Miner in JAVA

This is my semestral project for JAVA1 subject. Project was about the game which we could pick and have to do in java. My pick was Manic Miner, because it is a gamem that i played in the childhood. Also my father have big connection with this game, so it was my pick number one. 

Game have only one level, but i have very good strucuture of the code, so the implementing of the next caves should be easy.
